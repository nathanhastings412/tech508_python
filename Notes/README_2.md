# Day 2

### Task Review

IDs
- if x = 5 and is then overridden as x = 10, the ID changes as the ID refers to the object (the value)
- Immutable data types are values that cannot be changed without a reassignment
- Mutable data types have the ability to change their objects (values)

### Understanding Operators

- Operator - action (add, subtract etc.)
- Operand - the object the operator is acting on

### Strings

- if you use "" to define the string and you wish to use speech marks in the string, you must then use '' within the string
- There is no best practice, discuss within the team which practice you want to use

### String methods

### Notes

Why choose python
- Being a support engineer we likely will not be choosing languages to use
- Python has extensive libraries and frameworks that can help make out work easier
- Syntax is simple and readable
- Strong community support and resources

How can it help with support engineering?
- Automate repetitive tasks through scripting

Why understand and use APIs?
- Automate interactions with cloud services and infrastructure
- Used with various tools and platforms
- Used to retrieve and manipulate data in external systems and services
