## Day 2

### Consolidation questions
- What is the cloud?
  - centrally managed
  - delivered as a service over the internet
  - available on demand
- is running things in the cloud always better security?
  - partly - yes because the data is extremely secure, but you do not have access to the physical hardware
  - you do not know who has access to the physical hardware
- can you get into a private cloud system from the outside?
  - no
- Different types of services
  - on premises - you have maximal control and maximal responsibility
  - IaaS - gives you quite a bit to manage but more control, you have access to everything but the infrastructure
  - PaaS - you have less control and therefore fewer responsibilities - your code has to be secure
  - SaaS - you just manage the data and everything else falls on the cloud service provider
- what is a hybrid cloud model?
  - a mix of private(on-prem) and public cloud services (a database might be on prem)

### Interview stuff
- Need to know why I want to be a support engineer
  - I have had one or two technical issues in the past (be specific)
  - I found a fair amount of satisfaction in troubleshooting and diagnosing the problem and the successfully resolving the problem
  - This opportunity arose

### stop folder from being included in git repo
- git command `ls -a` shows the hidden folder
- if a folder is already being tracked by git, and then you ignore it, it will still be in the github repo
