# Concatenation is combining strings to create new strings

x = 2
y = 5.4
z = " there's now a number 25.4 unless we put a space in!"

print(str(x) + str(y) + z)

# this did not work as python is strongly typed, and you must explicitly determine the data types
# for concatenation, we must explicitly turn variables x and y into strings
