# Outcome (By doing this you should): Practice using lists and dictionaries
# Script should act like a waiter at a restaurant taking orders

# level 1

# Greet the user

# Print a list of starters

starters = ["gyoza", "garlic bread", "chicken satay skewers"]
print(starters)

# Take an input for the user for their starter

# Print a list of mains

mains = ["lasagne", "mac n' cheese", "beef rigatoni"]
print(mains)

# Take an input for the user for their main course

# Print a list of desserts

# Take an input for the user for their dessert

# Print all of the user's choices

# level 2
# Use at least one f-string
# Add each item ordered to a list called 'customer_order_list'

# level 3 (may need research if we have not covered dictionaries yet)
# Use dictionaries and assign prices to the items. Create a bill at the end of the program.

# level 4
# Add more to this program. Recommended ways are: Only allow input that is within the list, Add quantities of order etc.
