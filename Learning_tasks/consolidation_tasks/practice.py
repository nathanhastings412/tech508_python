# = is used to create a variable - it is assignment
# == is equal to - it is compariso

# x = 5
# y = "5"

# print(x == y) - False
# print(x == int(y)) - True
# swap the values
# a = 10
# b = 20
# a, b = b, a

# number = None
#
# while number != 0:
#     number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
#     if number > 0:
#         print("positive")
#     elif number < 0:
#         print("negative")
#     else:
#         print("zero")

# for i in range(1, 6):
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         print(f"{i} is even")
#     else:
#         print(f"{i} is odd")

# for loops loop through every item in an iterable
# while loops loop while a condition is active

# a list is made between [,] and can be ammended
# a tuple cannot be ammended and is made with (,)

# my_list[-1]

# nums.pop(2)
# also nums.remove(3)

# def greet(name):
#     print(f"Hello {name}")
#
# greet("John")

# parameter is the variable in the function definition (e.g. name in def greet(name))
# argument is the actual value passed (e.g. "John")
# return sends a value back from the function to the caller
